Overview
--------

Voice cart is an android app which serves as a handy grocery shopping cart. Apart from being able to save your shopping cart, it has other handy features including one click email or cloud save options. One of the major issues when shopping is to remember what to purchase. Voice Cart tries to solve that problem by having an option to auto generate your shopping cart based on previous purchase history and the frequency of purchase of specific items. In addition to these, it has custom voice commands to ease data entry.
